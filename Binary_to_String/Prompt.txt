Binary to String:
	Given a real number between 0 and 1 (e.g., 0.72) that is passed in as a double, print the binary
	representation. If the number cannot be represented accurately in binary with at most 32
	characters, print "ERROR".
Hints:
	#143: To wrap your head around the problem, try thinking about how you'd do it for integers.
	#167: In a number like 0.893 (base 10), what does each digit signify? What then does each digit
	in 0.10010 signify in base 2?
	#173: A number such as 0.893 (base 10) indicates 8 * 10^-1 + 9 * 10^-2 + 3 * 10^-3. Translate
	this into base 2.
	#269: How would you get the first digit in 0.893? If you multiplied by 10, you'd shift the values
	over to get 8.93. What happens if you multiply by 2?
	#297: Think about what happens for values that can't be represented accurately in binary.
